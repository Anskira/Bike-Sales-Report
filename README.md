# Sales Report

## Problem Statement
In this project I have created an interactive Power BI dashboard that displays key performance metrics for informed decision making for Toman Bike Share. The dashboard 
visualizes metrics like Hourly Revenue Analysis, Profit and Revenue Trends, Seasonal Revenue and Rider demographics. The purpose of this project is to recommend the raising price for 
the next year.
